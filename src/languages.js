/**
 * The languages this library publishes — one entry per audio track Bunny
 * encodes, in the order they should appear in a picker.
 *
 * The `code` is what gets passed to the player as `preferredAudioLang`. Two of
 * them cannot be resolved from the manifest alone and need an entry in
 * `trackAliases` (see README, "When Bunny writes the wrong tag"):
 *
 *   yue    — Bunny rejected the code and wrote LANGUAGE="en" NAME="Audio"
 *   pt-br  — both Portuguese dubs are tagged "pt"; only the NAME differs
